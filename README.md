  ## <span id="installation"> Installation: </span>
  <br>


 
  
  - Download the code via your preferred method, by clicking the green code button at the top of this page. 

  - If you don't have Node.js, you can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

  - Once you're sure the above steps are completed, the dependencies (and their sub-dependencies) are easily installed by navigating to the project's local directory within your command line and entering the below code:

```bash
npm i
```

  - Once installed, it's time to source the data by logging into MySQL


  ```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

  -Enter your password, then run:

```bash
source db/schema.sql;
```
 
 DON'T FORGET YOUR LINE ENDING SEMI-COLONS IN SQL

   -Promptly exit sql by typing "quit" or "exit".

   -Then to seed the data, simply:

 ```bash
npm run seed
```

Once that is successful:

```bash
npm start
```

and the back-end will be up and running.

Access the data by either the browser, or a REST API client such as Insomnia.
